> Smallholder farmers in rural South Africa face unpredictable crop yields due to variable rainfall, soil quality, and climate shifts, leading to food insecurity and lost income. Without affordable tools, they rely on guesswork, resulting in over/under-planting and wasted resources. Existing apps are urban/commercial-focused, data-heavy, and require constant internet — impractical for off-grid farms in areas like Sterkspruit.

> FarmYield Predictor is an offline-first C++/Python app that takes simple inputs (crop type, rainfall mm, soil pH, planting date), uses a lightweight ML model (linear regression on historical SA agri data) to predict yields (e.g., "Maize: 4.2 tons/ha"), and generates a printable planting calendar with risk alerts (e.g., "Low rain risk — plant drought-resistant variety"). Runs 100% offline after initial data load. Exports CSV for sharing via WhatsApp.
